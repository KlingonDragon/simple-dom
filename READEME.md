# Simple DOM
Utility functions for DOM manipulation
## Usage
I don't use npm or other packaging software so I can't provide any instructions on using them.

Add functions globally to a project:
```js
import 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/klingondragon/simple-dom/index.min.js';
```
or
```html
<head>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/klingondragon/simple-dom/index.min.js"></script>
</head>
```
## Type Checking in an IDE
Unfortunatly, the only method I've found to use this in a js project is to download [`types.d.ts`](./types.d.ts)
